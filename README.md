# Atlas Updater
**âš  DO NOT USE THIS YET! This is being developed right now, will be finished very soon.**

Atlas Updater is a simple batch script to update [Atlas'](https://github.com/Atlas-OS/Atlas) (a free and performant modification to Windows 10) folders (the [AtlasModules](https://github.com/Atlas-OS/Atlas/tree/main/src/AtlasModules) and [Atlas desktop](https://github.com/Atlas-OS/Atlas/tree/main/src/Desktop/Atlas) folders). Useful to contributors, general testers or people that are curious. Tested on Windows 10 21H2 with the latest PowerShell. Feel free to make a pull request to improve the script! :)
